# Project Intern

The systems for metadata in all our platforms will always have inconsistencies, missing data, etc. Project Intern lets users connect their GitHub accounts to Refracture in order to report these issues and or suggest changes to the media's metadata.

Usage: In extras tab \(・・・\) there will be an option to _Report/Suggest Metadata_ .

Here you can describe the issue, or change specific parts of the metadata yourself. There are two options **suggest**, which will change it for _you_ and **submit for review,** this asks our team of moderators, to see if _everyone_ see the edits.

Intentional Spam will result in moderators blocking/ignoring your submissions and/or suspension of your account.
